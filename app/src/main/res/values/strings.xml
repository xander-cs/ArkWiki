    <string name="ingredient">%s x %s</string>
    <string name="requirements_title">Requirements</string>
    <string name="requirements">For creatures to successfully mate, they must be:\n\t\t- of same species\n\t\t- of opposite sex (one male and one female)\n\t\t- within mating range of each other\n\t\t- wandering or set to mate (Enable Wandering or Enable Mating must be enabled on both creatures)\n\t\t- not following anything (Disable Following on both creatures)\n\t\t- unburdened (the creatures must not be carrying so much weight they are unable to move)\n\t\t- not mounted\n\t\t- not spayed/neutered\n\t\t- not having a mating cooldown (once mated females have a mating cooldown interval before they can mate again, the cooldown can also be triggered when transferring the creature between Arks)</string>
    <string name="range_title">Mating Range While Wandering:</string>
    <string name="range">If using the Enable Wandering method to allow for mating, then steps need to be taken to maintain the mating range, which varies between species and is loosely based on the size of the adult creature. If the mating pair wander outside the mating range, then mating is stopped and mating progress is reset.\n\nBuilding a pen of a suitably small size to keep the wandering creatures within mating range of each other is one common approach.</string>
    <string name="mating_title">Mating:</string>
    <string name="mating">When the above conditions are all met, a small red heart icon appears over the heads of the mating creatures, and a mating bar appears on the female\'s HUD (look at the female to reveal the HUD). The HUD also indicates which creature they are mating with.\n\nOnce the mating bar is completed, non-mammalian females drop a single fertilized egg , and mammalian females start gestating.</string>
    <string name="special_conditions_title">Special Conditions:</string>
    <string name="special_conditions">Some of the creatures will only mate when certain conditions are given.\n\t\t- Royal Griffin - will only mate with the other gender with similar surname.\n\t\t- Ferox - will only mate when the female is at least 95%+ addiction as a small creature.\n\t\t- Magmasaur - will only mate when the female is submerged in the lava surface in Volcano Region on any map.\n\t\t- Megachelon - will only mate at deep depths in the ocean.\n\t\t- Beelzebufo - will only mate in water.\n\t\t- Diplocaulus - will only mate in water</string>
    <string name="wait_title">Mating Wait Interval:</string>
    <string name="wait">Females cannot mate again until a mating wait interval has passed (Cryofreezing them will still continue the mating interval cooldown). This interval is indicated on their HUD.\n\nThe mating interval starts after the creature has laid the egg or gestation has completed. The mating interval is also started for female creatures that are transferred between servers. Males can mate at any time.</string>
    <string name="incubation_title">Incubation:</string>
    <string name="incubation">Incubation is the process of hatching Fertilized Eggs into babies as part of breeding.\n\nIncubation requires time and a steady temperature, e.g. by isolation in a room, fire, Otter/Dimetrodon , or Air Conditioners can be used to increase or decrease the temperature respectively. The amount of time an incubated egg requires before it hatches into a baby dinosaur depends on the species of the parents. To incubate, the egg must be placed directly on the floor/ground; if the temperature is not correct, the egg will lose health until it dies.\n\nThe incubation can be \'paused\' by picking up the egg. Place the egg in a refrigerator to preserve it longer, the incubation progress will be saved.</string>
    <string name="placeholder">%s</string>
    <string name="ko_title">Knock-out Taming:</string>
    <string name="ko">1. First, render the creature unconscious.\n\n2. Once the creature is unconscious, open its inventory and feed it an appropriate food item by dragging food into its inventory and waiting for the creature to eat it. The food needed to tame it will vary based on the creature you are trying to tame. Keep plenty of food in the animal\'s inventory while taming; if the creature runs out of food, the taming bar will begin to go down until it gets more food. Force feeding them anything other than Narcoberries or Narcotic will fill their hunger but will not affect the taming bar, effectively making the tame take longer.\n\t\t- Herbivores will eat Berries and Crops\n\t\t- Carnivores will eat Meat\n\t\t- Some creatures, like Araneo and Pulmonoscorpius, will eat other items like spoiled meat.\n\t\t- Most creatures will also eat kibble, which usually speeds up the process.\n\n3. Keep the creature unconscious throughout the process. The Unconscious bar decreases with the creature\'s  Torpor, and can be refilled with Narcoberries or Narcotic. The creature will not voluntarily eat these items, and so they must be force fed by hitting the use-key in the creatures inventory when hovering over the item.</string>
    <string name="nv_title">Non-Violent Taming (NV):</string>
    <string name="nv" tools:ignore="TypographyDashes">Many creatures can also be tamed without knocking them out.\n\n1. Put the food you plan to feed to the creature in the farâ€“right slot of your hotbar.\n\t\t- Some examples of non-violent taming are:- Araneo will eat Meat.\n\t\t- Chalicotherium takes Beer.\n\t\t- Dung Beetle takes Feces or Spoiled Meat.\n\t\t- Gigantopithecus will eat Berries.\n\n2. Approach the creature and press the use key to feed it when prompted.\n\t\t- Lystrosaurus, Moschops, and Ichthyosaurus are peaceful and won\'t run when you approach them and you won\'t lose taming effectivness should you touch them.\n\t\t- Most other creatures will run away or attack you if you approach and you will lose taming effectivness should you touch them.\n\t\t- For other creatures, Ghillie Armor is recommended and Bug Repellant will help when taming bugs and the Onyc as they may attack when touched.\n\n3. Wait for the creature to become hungry enough up to roughly 90% of its hunger ex:36000-40000 to eat again. This can take varying amounts of time depending on the creature in question and the food you are feeding it.\n\n4. Repeat this process until the taming bar is filled.\n\nNote that the first instance of food you feed to the creature is akin to knocking it unconscious with a violent tame - it binds the tame to the Survivor (or their tribe) and the creature\'s hunger will begin decreasing. At this point - the taming effectiveness and taming progress will not begin to diminish unless the creature starts taking damage (i.e. enters combat or starts dying of starvation). The initial delay between the first and second feedings compared to all subsequent feedings is also greater. Once fed a second time, progress will begin to reset if you take too long to feed. Moving too far away before a second feeding will also un-bind the tame - resetting everything (although its food may take a few moments to update).</string>
    <string name="unv_title">Unique Non-Violent Taming:</string>
    <string name="unv">Some dinos must be tamed with unique methods.\n\t\t- Equus takes Rockarrot while ridden on, calming with the said food when it starts its attempt to kick the survivor off.\n\t\t- Hyaenodon needs to be pet without being spooked or aggravated.\n\t\t- Hesperornis and Otter eats Dead Fish Dead Fish that the player drags to the creature.\n\t\t- Liopleurodon swims towards the nearest dropped Giant Bee Honey Giant Bee Honey from the player.\n\n\t\t- Troodon kills tamed dino for thrills and sports.With the exception of Hyaenodon, Liopleurodon, Phoenix Phoenix, and Troodon, they too follow the same process in waiting to become hungry enough to eat again.</string>
    <string name="tt_title">Turret Taming:</string>
    <string name="tt">For certain creatures, such as the Titanosaur, Rock Elemental, Karkinos and Astrocetus, tranquilizers are ineffective. In order to inflict torpor on them, you will need to do damage to their head using a turret weapon. The most efficient weapon is the Cannon, as it\'s torpor-to-damage ratio will be the highest. Although you can also use the Rocket Launcher on Rock Elemental, and the Catapult Turret on the Karkinos. Although related, Rubble Golem can\'t be tamed.</string>
    <string name="ro_title">Raise-only Taming:</string>
    <string name="ro">Due to the nature of these creatures, they cannot be tamed as adults unlike most other creatures. In order to \'tame\' the said creatures, they have to be raised from birth. Following creatures can only be tamed from birth.\n\t\t- Deinonychus - Steal an egg of their species from a Deinonychus Nest located in the The White Cliffs of Valguero, or breed with two raised Deinonychus.\n\t\t- Wyvern - Steal an egg from the Wyvern Nest in the World Scar found in Scorched Earth or in Dragonmalte Trench, Wyvern Cave or MurderSnow (Ice Wyvern only) found in Ragnarok and The Great Trench in Valguero (Fire Wyvern and Ice Wyvern only), or breed with two raised Wyverns with similar type (I.E: two poison wyvern), all kinds of wyvern eggs (except crystal variants) can be found on the new Lost Island map.- Rock Drake - Steal an egg from a Rock Drake Nest in Grave of the Lost, found below Aberration.- Reaper King - Weaken an aggravated Reaper Queen until it is at 1k-2k hp, turn off the charge light of your Glow Pet, and get its attention to be impregnated. Found at any Element Regions in Aberration.-Magmasaur - Steal an egg from a Magmasaur Nest found inside the Volcanic Cave at Genesis: Part 1 or in the lava caverns at the coast of the volcano on Lost Island, or breed with two raised Magmasaur in a lava pool/puddle.</string>
